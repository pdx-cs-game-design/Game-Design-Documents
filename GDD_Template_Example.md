# Detailed Game Design Documentation Template

##  Notes/Background

Document your game design so that you and any other stakeholders in the game (the team,
management, etc.) know in as much detail as they need what the game is, what is needed to
complete it, and why it's worth building.

Your design documentation serves as the embodiment of the vision for the game shared by the
team. It's also be a roadmap and guide for during development. This documentation covers the
qualities of the player's experience, how the game behaves to support that, and the reasons
why you made various decisions along the way.

Note that all this is necessary even if you are alone on the project: six months from now it will
be very easy to forget why you wanted something a certain way. Having to re-think it later can
lead you to poor decisions or design thrashing (where you bounce between two lousy options
instead of finding an effective one).

In other words, your design documentation is both _backward-looking_ and _forward-looking_ : it
records the decisions you made and their rationales, and provides a map and a guide for
developing the game going forward.

**Guidelines to Follow**
Creating your design docs as a mixture of text, systems and UX diagrams, equations, etc., helps
anyone who reads it understand your game. **You are encouraged to use pictures, diagrams,
flow models, etc., wherever possible.** If there's something you can adequately represent with a
picture or diagram rather than a block of text, do so!

Treat your design document like a blueprint for a building. Be precise in describing the design
details. Avoid being vague, and state aspects of the design in present tense (the game _behaves_
this way, not “the game will behave”). Avoid waffling words like “the game might...” This
documentation is where you stake out the game in no uncertain terms. Except when describing
high-level aspects of the design, do not use qualitative phrases like “this enemy moves fast” or
“this results in a big explosion” or “this turret turns left and right.”

How fast? How big? How far? Whenever a quantity is called for (number of skills or levels,
amount of damage, etc.), supply a number, a defined range, or a reference to an equation or
other determining factor. If a decision on a specific number has not yet been made, say so, and
call it out as an issue to be resolved. Being precise in your writing forces you to eliminate the
fuzziness that can accompany a design that is all in your head. It is far easier to discuss and find
the holes in a proposal than an idea.


That said, here is a warning: creating too much design documentation can be as detrimental to
your game as creating too little. If you know the details of a part of the game, document it using
text, diagrams, mockups, etc. If you're not sure, document what you're trying to create, your
best ideas for how to do it, and what paths you've discarded – and then create prototypes
(paper or electronic) to test out the ideas. Don't waste time documenting a lot of different
options, much less arguing about them: find the area of uncertainty and prototype it. Then
once the path you want to take is clear, document that and why you chose it.

**The Goal**
By combining text, diagrams, mockups, and/or prototypes, your design documentation provides
enough information for anyone concerned to understand

- what the game is
- what the player's experience is – why they will play it
- what your goals are for it – why you are making it
- what its current status is
- how, in precise detail, to build it

Anything that doesn't contribute to this is wasted effort to be avoided or removed.

**Keep it Current**
Any design documentation is only as good as it is current. Game designs are often referred to as
“living” documents, in that they change as the game development progresses. As such, plan
from the beginning to update your design as development proceeds. You will find new ideas,
uncover new problems, and change the overall design as you make the game.

While your design docs need to be complete enough to guide the implementation of the game,
do not treat them as a “design bible” that is written once and never changed. Doing so is the
fastest way to make your design documentation obsolete and irrelevant, and leave the team
without a usable plan for how to create the game.

Encourage team members to comment on existing design docs “off to the side” – this can mean
different things depending on the technology you're using. If it's possible to have people
comment on the same page as the design (as in Word, Google Docs, and similar programs) this
can work well and allow for conversations about the design within the doc. Otherwise you may
need to have a “shadow doc” that parallels the main documents but contains _only_ the
comments and discussion about the design docs they accompany. The design docs themselves
contain only the current state of the design, not any conversations or commentary.

As part of maintaining the design docs, either include these in your version control system to
keep a log of changes and dates, or insert a log at the top of each section to show its history.

**Divide and Conquer**
On a multi-person team, each designer (and sometimes producers and others) may be assigned
particular parts of the documentation to maintain and keep current. It is typically a good idea to
assign the more general parts of the documentation to the more senior members of the design
team, and the more detailed parts to the more junior members. That is, a junior designer is


more likely to be assigned a particular feature or system and the Lead Designer or equivalent
the responsibility of maintaining the game concept and vision.

**Organization and Adaptation**
There is no one best method for organizing a game's design docs. What's presented here will
probably work well for your game, but adapt it as necessary. Remember, the point is to give
anyone who reads it the information they need in the most effective way: don't make them
hunt for the particular information they want, nor be left wondering about some aspect of the
game that concerns them.

It's useful to present your design docs so that the broadest, most general information is
immediately apparent, and then progressively reveal more detailed information as needed. This
is the model used here. The “main page” covered here gives the reader an immediate
understanding of the game's purpose and current status. On this page links leads the interested
reader to additional levels of detail. These are then separate sections that describe each part of
the design in progressively more detail, with links between sections as appropriate.



## The Design's Overview

**Working Title**
Your game's title communicates the gameplay and the style of the game

**Current status**
In a few sentences, state the game's current status: is it still being designed, are parts being prototyped, or is the whole thing ready for greenlight for production? Is it on schedule? Are there significant issues worth calling out as part of general
status?

A useful way to phrase this is as the game's own Scrum report:


- What parts of the design are complete or have been reviewed?
- Which parts are being worked on?
- What if any blockers to progress are there
- What if any debt or major issues have arisen?

**Concept Statement**
In one or two sentences (“your game in a tweet,” or “a few words that create a question”)
describe the most important aspects of your game. What is its theme and setting? What makes
the game fun? How many players are there? Is it a quick pick-up game or a huge epic? Why
would someone want to play the game?

Don't try to cram too much information into a quick statement, but don't leave out vital aspects
of your game either. This can be a tough balancing act. Expect to spend some time iterating and
polishing this.

**Genre**
While genre statements about the gameplay (“this is a bullet-hell platformer”) are helpful to
calibrate what the game is and isn't, avoid vague statements that don't actually inform the
reader (“this is a Castlevania-like game”) and that may hide lazy thinking about the details of
the game's design (if it's “a Castlevania-like game” what exactly does that mean for _your_
game?).

Note that single-genre games are often less interesting as the space has likely been well-
explored. Genre hybrids or combinations can create interesting new angles on existing
gameplay, but beware of a “something for everyone” design that contains multiple genres, as
these often end up being a mishmash that's fun for no one.

**Target Audience**
Who is the target player for this game? What other games might they have played? What is
their age range or other relevant interests or attributes? What is the desired ESRB rating?

**Concept Paragraph and Unique Selling Points**
Expanding on the Concept Statement, provide the reader with an overview of the gameplay.
_Briefly_ cover the game's core loops, player progression, setting, look and feel, and any other
aspects that are necessary to understand the core appeal of the game.

In particular, highlight your game's _unique selling points_ (USPs): what are the things that makes
your game fresh, intriguing, new, and worth someone's time? Your game's USPs must be clearly
understood by you and anyone who reads the design docs. If for some reason you can't state
these clearly, or if they don't feel compelling, this is a sign that you need to rethink or refocus
your design. By reading your game's USPs, a player (who isn't you!) can see why they would
want to play your game instead of all the others like it that already exist.

A link to a current prototype, or even a video of a prototype, goes here once one exists.


**Player Experience**
Who is the player in the game? What is the setting? How long does the game last? What is the
fantasy or aspiration the game grants the player? What emotions does the player feel by
playing the game? What are the major phases of the player's experience in the game? (This
section can link to “Player Objectives and Progression” and leave most of the detail to that part
of the design.)

**Key Moments**
As part of the player experience, and to help others understand the design, _briefly_ discuss a few
“key moments” in the game. Typical examples include an initial positive experience in the first
1-5 minutes of the game; key struggles that must be overcome; and major victory,
achievement, or resolution points the player experiences as part of their arc through the game.

**Art, sound and music**
This section contains high-level information and examples about the visual and auditory style
for the game, as well as links to more specific information.

The high-level information here includes reference and concept art (and where possible, music)
to give the reader an idea of the visual style and tone for the game. Reference art may be taken
from movies, books, other games, etc., so long as it is not used in the game in any way. Concept
art (if any) must be original to the game. This art gives the reader a clear idea of the
environments, characters, opponents, objects, major locations, key events, user interface, etc.
in the game.

A separated (linked) doc, usually in the form of a spreadsheet, delineates all known art and
sound assets that are needed for the game. This includes all user interface assets, animations,
environments, characters, etc, **in complete detail**.

**Current Target Platform (and any system requirements)**
What is the first or current platform for the game – PC, web, tablet, phone, or something else?
Keep this to the current target platform; leave off any “future” desired platforms.

**Competition**
What games are similar from the player's point of view, or would compete directly with your
game? Show their name, release date, any revenue and budget information you can find, and a
brief description of each. Also include a brief description of what sets your game apart.

**Monetization**
If the game is “free to play” or has in-game purchases, these need to be wholly integrated with
the rest of the design. This section provides an overview of the monetization philosophy and
the major systems. It is heavily linked with the systems and features section.

# Example GDD for Robot Finds Kitten

**Game Overview**

**2.1. Game Concept**

"Robot Finds Kitten" is a zen-like, minimalist exploration game with a focus on humor and simplicity. The player controls a robot that navigates a two-dimensional field filled with various objects. The aim of the game is to find the kitten hidden among these objects. Each object, when examined, provides a unique, usually humorous or absurdist, message. There are no enemies, levels, or time constraints — the sole purpose is to locate the kitten, creating a relaxing and amusing experience.

**2.2. Target Audience**

"Robot Finds Kitten" has broad appeal due to its easy mechanics and humoristic approach. It's suitable for all age groups but might be particularly appealing to players looking for a casual, relaxing game experience. Those who appreciate a touch of absurd humor or nostalgia for older, minimalist games would also find this game engaging.

**2.3. Genre(s)**

The game falls into the Casual, Exploration, and Humor genres.

**2.4. Game Flow Summary**

Upon starting the game, the player is introduced to a simple interface that displays a field filled with ASCII characters representing the robot, the objects, and the yet-to-be-found kitten. The player controls the robot, moving it around the field using simple keyboard commands (such as arrow keys). When the robot encounters an object, the player can examine it, triggering a text message at the bottom of the screen.

The game continues until the robot finds the object that is, in fact, the kitten. Upon finding the kitten, a congratulatory message is displayed, the game ends, and then restarts, randomizing the objects and the kitten's location for a new round.

**2.5. Look and Feel**

"Robot Finds Kitten" adopts a minimalist, retro ASCII art aesthetic, which gives it a nostalgic feel harking back to early computer games. The game doesn't have elaborate visuals or animations; instead, it uses simple ASCII characters to represent the game elements.

The field, objects, robot, and kitten are all represented by different characters or symbols, creating a monochrome 'map' that the player navigates. This simple and abstract visual style leaves plenty of room for imagination and focuses the player's attention on the core mechanic of exploration and the humor in the object descriptions.



**Gameplay**

**3.1. Objectives**

The primary and only objective of "Robot Finds Kitten" is for the player, who controls a robot, to locate a hidden kitten among various other objects on a field. Each round of the game is complete when the robot finds the kitten.

**3.2. Game Progression**

The game doesn't progress in the traditional sense with levels or increased difficulty over time. Instead, each game is a fresh start with the kitten and the objects randomly placed in different locations on the field. This means that each round provides a new exploration experience for the player.

**3.3. Play Flow**

The player starts a round by moving the robot around the field. This is done using simple keyboard controls. Upon bumping into an object, a humorous or absurdist message associated with that object is displayed. The player continues exploring until the robot finds the kitten, which triggers a congratulatory message and ends the game round. The game then immediately starts a new round, again randomizing the location of the kitten and the objects.

**3.4. Mission/Challenge Structure**

"Robot Finds Kitten" does not have typical missions or challenges found in many games. The only 'mission' is to find the kitten among the various objects. There is no time limit or penalties for incorrect guesses, reinforcing the game's zen-like, stress-free nature.

**3.5. Puzzle Structure**

While not a puzzle game in the traditional sense, the exploration of objects can be seen as a kind of puzzle. Each object presents a new 'piece' in the form of its unique text description. The 'solution' to this puzzle comes when the player finds the object that is actually the kitten. The game encourages curiosity and trial-and-error investigation, and while there's no wrong choice, the reward comes in finding the right one: the kitten.



**Mechanics**

**4.1. Rules**

The rules of "Robot Finds Kitten" are straightforward and implicit. The player's task is to move the robot around the field to examine objects and find the kitten. There's no penalty for examining incorrect objects and no time limit to find the kitten. The round ends when the robot finds the kitten.

**4.2. Model of the Game Universe**

The game universe is a two-dimensional, grid-based field populated by randomly placed ASCII characters. These characters represent the robot, the kitten, and other objects. The objects, robot, and kitten do not interact with each other beyond the robot's ability to examine objects.

**4.3. Physics**

As an ASCII-based game, "Robot Finds Kitten" doesn't incorporate real-world physics. The robot moves grid cell by grid cell, with no momentum, gravity, or other physical forces at play.

**4.4. Economy**

There's no in-game economy in "Robot Finds Kitten", as there's no currency, points, items to collect, or any exchange of resources.

**4.5. Character Movement in the Game**

The player-controlled robot can move up, down, left, or right, one space at a time across the grid. There are no restrictions on where it can move within the field.

**4.6. Objects**

The robot doesn't physically pick up or move objects. Instead, it 'examines' them by moving into their grid cell, which triggers a text message.

**4.7. Actions**

The game uses simple keyboard inputs to control the robot's movement. Interaction with objects is automatic when the robot moves onto the same space as an object, revealing a humorous or absurdist description.

**4.8. Combat**

There is no combat or conflict in "Robot Finds Kitten". The focus is solely on exploration and finding the kitten.

**4.9. Screen Flow**

There is essentially just one screen in the game: the field where the robot explores. After finding the kitten, a congratulatory message is displayed, then the game restarts with a freshly randomized field.

**4.10. Game Options**

The original version of "Robot Finds Kitten" didn't include options. However, modern adaptations could incorporate settings for text speed, color schemes, or grid size to adjust the difficulty or aesthetic experience.

**4.11. Replaying and Saving**

As each round of the game is brief and self-contained, there's no need for a save feature. The game restarts automatically after the kitten is found, allowing for immediate replay.

**4.12. Cheats and Easter Eggs**

The original "Robot Finds Kitten" didn't have traditional cheats or Easter eggs. However, the game's charm lies in the vast array of unique and humorous messages associated with the objects, which could be considered the game's own version of 'Easter eggs' due to their surprising and entertaining nature.

**Story and Narrative**

**5.1. Back story**

The game "Robot Finds Kitten" does not explicitly provide a backstory. It starts with a robot and its quest to find a kitten amidst various objects. The simplicity of the setting and gameplay is part of its charm.

**5.2. Plot Elements**

The plot of the game is encapsulated in its title: a robot is trying to find a kitten. The journey towards this objective, and the humorous text that accompanies each object the robot encounters, form the entirety of the game's plot.

**5.3. Game Story Progression**

The story doesn't progress in the traditional sense. Each round is its own self-contained story of the robot's journey to find the kitten, reset each time the kitten is found.

**5.4. Cut Scenes**

"Robot Finds Kitten" does not include cut scenes. The narrative is advanced through the exploration of objects and the humorous messages they reveal.

**Game World**

**6.1. General Look and Feel of World**

The game world is an abstract, minimalist, two-dimensional grid. The world's visual style is rendered in ASCII art, which gives the game a retro, text-based feel.

**6.2. Areas**

**6.2.1. General Description and Physical Characteristics**

The game world is a flat, featureless grid, populated by randomly placed ASCII symbols representing the robot, the kitten, and the objects. Each grid cell can be thought of as an 'area', but they do not possess unique characteristics beyond hosting an object, the robot, or the kitten.

**6.2.2. How They Relate to the Rest of the World**

Every 'area' (grid cell) is part of the overall field and is equally likely to host the robot, the kitten, or any given object when a new game begins.

**Characters**

**7.1. For each character**

**7.1.1. Back Story**

The game does not provide backstories for the robot or the kitten. They exist solely for the game's main objective: for the robot to find the kitten.

**7.1.2. Personality**

The game doesn't explicitly characterize the robot or the kitten, allowing the player to imbue them with whatever personality they imagine.

**7.1.3. Appearance**

Both the robot and the kitten are represented by simple ASCII symbols. Their appearance is left largely to the player's imagination.

**7.1.4. Abilities**

The robot's only ability is to move in four directions and 'examine' objects. The kitten does not display any abilities and remains static until found.

**7.1.5. Relevance to the Story**

Both the robot and the kitten are central to the game's narrative. The robot is the character controlled by the player, and the kitten is the game's ultimate objective.

**7.1.6. Relationship to Other Characters**

In the context of the game, the robot's purpose is to find the kitten. Beyond this, there are no relationships between characters as there are no other characters in the game.

**7.2. Artificial Intelligence Use in Opponent and Enemy**

There are no opponents or enemies in "Robot Finds Kitten", and as such, no AI mechanics.

**7.3. Non-combat and Friendly Characters**

All characters in "Robot Finds Kitten" are non-combat and friendly. The player controls the robot, and the objective is to find the friendly kitten. The objects, while not characters, provide friendly, humorous interactions for the player.

**Levels**

"Robot Finds Kitten" is a single-level game, with each new round being a repetition of the same level with a randomized setup. There is no training level as the game's mechanics are extremely simple and intuitive.

**8.1. Training Level**

Not applicable. The simplicity of the game negates the need for a training level.

**8.2. For each level**

**8.2.1. Synopsis**

The level starts with the robot, the kitten, and a number of objects scattered randomly across the grid. The player navigates the robot to find the kitten among the objects.

**8.2.2. Required introductory material and how it is provided**

No introductory material is required due to the game's simplicity. The player simply begins with the task of finding the kitten.

**8.2.3. Objectives**

The sole objective of the level (and game) is for the robot to find the kitten.

**8.2.4. Details of what happens in the level**

**8.2.4.1. Map**

The game map is a flat, 2D grid filled with ASCII symbols representing the robot, the kitten, and various objects.

**8.2.4.2. Critical path that the player needs to take**

There's no critical path in the game. The player is free to navigate the robot in any direction until the kitten is found.

**8.2.4.3. Important and incidental encounters**

Every encounter with an object results in a humorous or absurdist message, but these encounters are incidental. The only important encounter is when the robot finds the kitten, ending the round.

**Interface**

**9.1. Visual System**

**9.1.1. HUD**
